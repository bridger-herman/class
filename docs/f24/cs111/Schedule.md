This is a rough schedule of topics for each day and the release and due dates for each homework assignment.

**Class topics and homework information may change over the course of the term.** Please treat this schedule as a rough guide for seeing what weâ€™ll be focusing on, and expect that there will be shifts as the term progresses. Most of the links will be dead until closer to the date.

Preparation should be completed **before** the class day that they are listed. Class is structured expecting that you have completed the preparation activities.
